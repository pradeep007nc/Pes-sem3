community cloud

saas(software as a service)
paas(platform as a service)
iaas(infrastructure as a service)


benifits of public cloud
    no need maintainence cost
    high scalability
    reduced complexity
    flexible pricing
    agile for innovation

limitation for public cloud
    potential for high tco
    decreased security and availability
    minimal control


benifits of private cloud
    dedicated and secure
    regulation complaiant
    customisable
    high scalability
    efficient

limitations of private lcoud
    expensive with high tco
    minimal mobile access
    limiting infrastructure

benifits of hybrid cloud
    policy driven deployement
    minimal security risks
    high scalability
    improved security

limitations
    potential for high tco
    compaptability and integration
    added complexity

cloud scalability
    vertical scaling - upgrading the resource(hardware)
    horizontal scaling - once the server is full next use other server(addition of same type resources)

deployement
    it is a iterative approach

    - Development design - variables include number of each tier computing, memory and storage
    - Performence evalutaion -  to verify wether application meets Performence requirements with deployement
                                monitoring of the workload on the application mad measuring the parameters such as response and time, throughput
                                utilisation of cpu in each tier is monitored

cloud deployement management tool - scaler(backup), right scale(design and deploy), kaarvo(automating and scalability), cloudstack(cost effective deployment).

replication is used to create and maintain multiple copy of data in cloud.
